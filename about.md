Hi, I am Thapelo Sebolai, a San Francisco-based software engineer from Johannesburg, SouthÂ Africa. I attended Stanford University where I studied Computer Science and graduated in 2020. I currently work at [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/) where I build frameworks to allow partner teams to build personalized products into Ads Manager using React and Hack. I previously interned at [Slack](https://slack.com/) and [Nylas](https://www.nylas.com/) where I largely worked on building new features into their APIs.

When I'm not parsing syntax-highlighted text, you can find me producing music in Ableton, playing in jazz ensembles on the weekend and reading books steeped in fantastical gryphons and wizards. On occasion, I polish my roundhouse kicks at my local Muay Thai gym and thrift for my next fashion piece.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thapelo-sebolai/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blackuaman) . Feel free to reach out to me!
